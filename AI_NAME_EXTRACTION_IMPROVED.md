# 🎯 AI Product Name Extraction - Improved

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### **Before (Simple):**
```typescript
// Just took first 3 words
"I am making a beautiful blue pottery vase"
→ Product Name: "I Am Making" ❌

"Small clay cup with handle"
→ Product Name: "Small Clay Cup" (OK but could be better)

"This is a handmade silver necklace"
→ Product Name: "This Is A" ❌
```

### **After (Smart):**
```typescript
// Finds the actual product type and extracts descriptive words
"I am making a beautiful blue pottery vase"
→ Product Name: "Blue Pottery Vase" ✅

"Small clay cup with handle"
→ Product Name: "Small Clay Cup" ✅

"This is a handmade silver necklace"
→ Product Name: "Handmade Silver Necklace" ✅
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### **Step 1: Find Product Type (Noun)**
```typescript
Product types recognized:
- Pottery: pot, vase, cup, bowl, plate, sculpture
- Textile: saree, dupatta, scarf, stole, shawl
- Jewelry: earring, necklace, bracelet, ring, pendant
- Woodwork: box, frame, furniture, chair, table
- Metalwork: diya, bell, urn, lamp, vessel
- Painting: painting, canvas, portrait, mural, art
- Hindi: बर्तन, गहना, कपड़ा, मूर्ति, चित्र
```

### **Step 2: Extract Descriptive Words**
```typescript
Remove stop words:
- English: a, an, the, with, made, of, from, in, for, and, or
- Phrases: i am, this is, that is, making, selling
- Hindi: एक, है, से, के, की, को, में, पर

Keep adjectives before the product type (max 2 words)
```

### **Step 3: Build Product Name**
```typescript
Format: [Adjective 1] [Adjective 2] [Product Type]
Capitalize each word
```
