## 🔍 How It Works

### **1. Category Detection:**
```typescript
Input: "Blue pottery vase"
Detected: pottery (from keywords: 'pottery', 'vase')
```

### **2. Size Detection:**
```typescript
Small keywords: small, mini, tiny, cup, earring, ring
Medium keywords: medium, vase, bowl, plate, scarf
Large keywords: large, big, saree, furniture, sculpture

Auto-detect:
- Short description (1-5 words) → Small
- Medium description (6-12 words) → Medium
- Long description (13+ words) → Large
```

### **3. Quality Factor:**
```typescript
Premium (+30%): handmade, intricate, detailed, gold, silk, luxury
Basic (-20%): simple, basic, plain

Example:
- "Intricate handmade vase" → +30% premium
- "Simple clay pot" → -20% discount
- "Blue pottery vase" → Standard (100%)
```

### **4. Price Calculation:**
```typescript
1. Get category: pottery
2. Get size: medium (detected from "vase")
3. Get range: ₹400 - ₹1,200
4. Base price: ₹400 + (₹800 × 0.7) = ₹960
5. Apply quality: ₹960 × 1.0 = ₹960
6. Round to ₹50: ₹950

Final suggested price: ₹950
