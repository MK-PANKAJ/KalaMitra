## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **File Modified:**
`src/components/OrderCard.tsx`

### **Changes Made:**
1. **Added MapPin icon** import from lucide-react
2. **Added conditional rendering** based on userRole
3. **Styled address section** with proper formatting

### **Code Logic:**
```typescript
{(userRole === 'artisan' || userRole === 'coordinator') && order.deliveryAddress && (
  <div className="mt-3 pt-3 border-t border-gray-200">
    <div className="flex items-start gap-2">
      <MapPin size={14} className="text-terracotta-600 mt-0.5 flex-shrink-0" />
      <div className="flex-1">
        <p className="text-xs font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-1">Delivery Address:</p>
        <p className="text-xs text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">{order.deliveryAddress}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```
