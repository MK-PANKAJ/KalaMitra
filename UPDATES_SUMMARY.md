# 🎉 KalaMitra Updates Summary

## ✅ What's Been Updated

### 1. **Quality Control Moved to Coordinator**
- ✅ **Coordinators now handle all QC**
- Artisans submit products → Products go to coordinator for QC review
- Products are `isActive: false` until coordinator approves
- **New QC Tab** in Coordinator Dashboard:
  - View all pending QC products
  - Complete QC checklist with photos
  - Approve (activates product) or Reject (deletes product)

### 2. **Enhanced Dispute Resolution**
- ✅ **4 Resolution Actions** available to coordinators:
  1. **Full Refund** - Money returned to buyer, artisan gets nothing
  2. **Partial Refund** - Both parties share the loss
  3. **Replacement** - Order restarted, artisan makes new item
  4. **No Action** - Favor artisan, payment released

- Each action automatically updates:
  - Order status
  - Payment release status
  - Dispute resolution record

### 3. **Complete Payment Flow for Buyers**
- ✅ **Payment Gateway Interface**:
  - Delivery address input (required)
  - Payment method selection (UPI/Card/Net Banking)
  - Order summary with breakdown
  - "Pay & Place Order" button

- Payment recorded before order creation
- Orders show "payment received" in milestones

### 4. **Backend Integration & Data Sync**
- ✅ All operations now use `backendService`:
  - Products saved to backend
  - Orders synced across accounts
  - Disputes tracked centrally
  
- **Data is now properly linked**:
  - When Buyer places order → Artisan sees it immediately
  - When Artisan updates → Coordinator and Buyer see changes
  - When Coordinator resolves dispute → Both parties notified

## 🔐 Data Flow (Technical)

```
localStorage: kalamitra_backend_db
├── users[] (artisans, buyers, coordinators)
├── products[] (shared across all)
├── orders[] (linked by buyerId + artisanId)
└── disputes[] (linked to orders)

When Buyer places order:
1. backendService.addOrder(order)
2. Saved to localStorage
3. dispatch({ type: 'ADD_ORDER' })

When Artisan logs in:
1. backendService.getOrders(userId, 'artisan')
2. Filters orders where artisanId === userId
3. Returns artisan's orders

When Coordinator logs in:
1. backendService.getOrders(userId, 'coordinator')
2. Returns ALL orders
3. Full visibility
```
